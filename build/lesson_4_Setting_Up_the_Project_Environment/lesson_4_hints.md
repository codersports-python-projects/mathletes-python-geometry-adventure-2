### Hints for Setup and Exploration 🌟

1. **Python Installation Troubles?** 🤔
   - Make sure you’ve downloaded the correct version for your operating system. Check the download page at [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/). If you encounter issues, try reinstalling and ensure you add Python to your PATH.

2. **Choosing a Code Editor?** 🖊️
   - Each editor has its strengths. If you’re new, start with Thonny for its simplicity. As you grow more comfortable, explore Visual Studio Code for additional features!

3. **Running Your First Script** 💡
   - If you don’t see the output, check that you saved your file and ran it correctly. You might need to open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to your project directory to run the script.

4. **Import Errors in `main.py`?** 🚨
   - Ensure your file names are correct and in the same directory. Check for typos in your import statements and function calls.
