# Lesson 4: Setting Up the Project Environment 🚀

Welcome, young Mathletes, to your next step in this Python-powered geometry adventure! Today, we're going to set up our coding environment and get familiar with the project files. Ready, set, code! 💻✨

## Lesson Overview

In this lesson, you'll learn how to:
- Set up your Python coding environment 📦
- Navigate the project structure 🗂️
- Understand the skeleton files provided to you. 🗒️

By the end of this lesson, you'll be all set to start coding like a pro! 👩‍💻👨‍💻

## Why Set Up a Project Environment?

Imagine you're a wizard about to brew a magical potion. Before you start, you need all your ingredients and tools in place, right? Our coding setup is like that magic lab! 🌟

## Getting Started: Setting Up Your Environment

### 1. Install Python 🐍
First, make sure Python is installed on your computer. If it's not, you can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Follow the instructions for your operating system.

### 2. Choose Your Code Editor ✏️
A code editor is like your magic wand! Here are some great options:
- **Visual Studio Code**: A powerful tool with lots of features.
- **PyCharm**: Great for Python-specific projects.
- **Thonny**: A simple option, perfect for beginners.

### 3. Open the Skeleton Project 🎒

Once you've got your editor, open the skeleton files we provided. These files are like the ingredients you need to start cooking up some awesome code!

```python
# Example of a Python script
print("Hello, Mathletes!")
```

### 4. Explore the Project Structure 🗺️

Let's take a tour of our project map!

```plaintext
project-directory/
│
├── main.py        # The main file where you'll start coding!
├── utils.py       # Helpful utilities for your project
└── features/      # Folder for additional features
    ├── feature1.py
    └── feature2.py
```

- **main.py**: This is your launchpad. 🚀
- **utils.py**: Handy tools to help you along the way.
- **features/**: This is where you'll expand your project with cool features!

### 5. Run Your First Script! 🏃‍♂️

Let's test that everything is working. Open `main.py` and add the following code:

```python
print("Welcome to the Mathletes Adventure!")
```

Save the file and run it. You should see the message printed out. If it works, give yourself a high five! 🖐️

### 6. Troubleshooting Tips 🛠️

- **Can't find Python?** Make sure it's installed and added to your PATH.
- **Errors in code?** Double-check your syntax and make sure everything is spelled correctly.

## Conclusion

You're now ready to dive into the world of coding and geometry with Python! Keep your environment tidy and your code clean. Great job setting up everything! Next stop: coding adventures! 🚀🌟

Happy coding, Mathletes! 🎉
