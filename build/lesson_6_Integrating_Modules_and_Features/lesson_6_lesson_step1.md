# Step 1: Organizing Your Modules 📂🗄️

Welcome, young wizards of code! 🧙‍♀️✨ Before we embark on our grand adventure of integration, we must first ensure our magical toolkit is well-organized and ready for action. Imagine you're preparing for a quest: your modules are your trusty tools, waiting to be called upon at a moment's notice! Let's dive into organizing them effectively.

### 🏗️ Setting Up a Magical Structure

Think of your project as a magical kingdom, with different realms (modules) that each play a unique role in the harmony of your land. Here's how we lay out our kingdom:

```plaintext
mathletes_project/
├── main.py
├── utils.py
├── features.py
└── modules/
    ├── geometry_tools.py
    ├── user_interaction.py
    └── visualization.py
```

- **`main.py`**: This is the royal court where all decisions are made and actions begin. It's where your entire project comes together in a grand symphony. 🎶
- **`utils.py`**: The library of spells, where all your magical calculations are stored. 📚
- **`features.py`**: The workshop where new tricks and features are crafted. 🛠️
- **`modules/`**: A hidden chamber full of specialized tools and scripts, waiting to be discovered! 🗝️

### 📋 Your Quest: Organize the Kingdom

#### Step-by-Step Instructions:

1. **Create Your Project Structure**:
   - Open your text editor or IDE.
   - Create a new folder named `mathletes_project`.
   - Inside, create the files `main.py`, `utils.py`, `features.py` and a folder called `modules`.
   - Inside `modules`, create `geometry_tools.py`, `user_interaction.py`, and `visualization.py`.

2. **Understand the Role of Each File**:
   - **`main.py`**: This is your command center. All the magic happens here.
   - **`utils.py`**: Store all your important functions here. It's like your spellbook! 🔮
   - **`features.py`**: A lab for experimenting with new ideas and features.
   - **`modules/`**: Keep specialized scripts here, safe and sound.

3. **Visualize the Flow**:
   - Here's how each part of your kingdom interacts:

   ```mermaid
   graph TD;
       A[main.py] --> B[utils.py];
       A --> C[features.py];
       B --> D[geometry_tools.py];
       C --> E[user_interaction.py];
       C --> F[visualization.py];
   ```

### 🌟 Let's Organize and Conquer!

Organizing your project is like laying the foundation of a castle. Without a strong base, the walls won't stand! Take this step seriously and prepare your kingdom for the adventures ahead. Once everything is in place, you'll be ready to integrate modules like a true master of code.
