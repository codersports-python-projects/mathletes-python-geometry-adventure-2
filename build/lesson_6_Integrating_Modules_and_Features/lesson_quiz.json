                    "To store all utility functions",
                    "To serve as the entry point and control flow of the application",

                    "To handle user interactions"
                ],
                "answer": "To serve as the entry point and control flow of the application",
                "explanation": "`main.py` is typically the main entry point of a Python application where the program begins execution and integrates all components."
