## Step 3: Debugging and Testing 🐞🔍

Ahoy, brave explorers of code! 🏴‍☠️ You've organized your kingdom and summoned your wizards. Now, it's time to ensure that your spells cast flawlessly! Debugging and testing are like a treasure hunt, where each clue brings you closer to a perfectly functioning program. Let's set sail on this adventure! 🧭

### The Treasure Map: Debugging Tips

Fear not, for every great coder has faced challenges. Here are some trusty tips to guide you through debugging:

- **Print Statements**: Use them like a flashlight in a dark cave to illuminate your program's flow.
- **Step-by-Step Execution**: Break down your program into small parts and test them independently.
- **Error Messages**: These are your pirate clues! Read them carefully as they often lead you directly to the issue at hand.

```python
# Example of debugging with print statements
print("Starting calculation...")
area = calculate_rectangle_area(10, 5)
print(f"Calculated area: {area}")
```

### Your Quest: Debug and Test the Code 🏴‍☠️

1. **Test Each Module**: Run the functions in each module to ensure they work as expected.
2. **Look for Bugs**: If something doesn't work, use print statements and check your logic.
3. **Celebrate Your Success**: Once your project runs smoothly, do a little victory dance! 🎉

### Flow of Integration: How Everything Fits Together 🌀

Let's visualize how your modules and features interact in your project:

    A[User Input] --> B[Main.py];
    B --> C[Utils.py];
    B --> D[Features.py];
    C --> E[Geometry Calculations];
    D --> F[Additional Features];
    E --> G[Display Results];
    F --> G;
```
