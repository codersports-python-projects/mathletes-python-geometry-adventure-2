### 🕵️‍♂️ Hints for Mathlete Wizards:

1. **Stuck on Imports?**
   - Double-check the spelling of module and function names. Spelling mistakes are like sneaky goblins, they hide well!
   - Ensure your import paths match your project structure. Think of them as secret passages connecting your kingdom's realms. 📜

2. **Trouble with Functions?**
   - Print statements are your crystal ball. Use them to reveal the value of variables and see the flow of your program. 🔮
   - Break down complex functions into smaller parts to see where the magic might be going astray.

3. **Errors and Debugging**
   - Don't panic! Errors are just clues. Read them carefully to uncover what the code is trying to tell you. 🕵️‍♀️
   - If your code isn't working, try solving a simpler problem first, then gradually add complexity.
