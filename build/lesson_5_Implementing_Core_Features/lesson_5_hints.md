### 🔍 **Hints for Mathletes**

1. **Stuck on Calculations?** 🤔
   - Remember the formulas! For rectangles: 
     - Area = length × width
     - Perimeter = 2 × (length + width)
   - For triangles, the area is half the base times the height.
   - Double-check your inputs and ensure you’re using the correct units.

2. **Having Trouble with User Input?** 🎤
   - Ensure you’re using the `input()` function correctly to capture user data.
   - Convert inputs to the correct data type, like `float`, to allow for decimal numbers.

3. **Confused by Errors?** 🚫
   - Read the error messages carefully; they often tell you exactly what’s wrong.
   - Syntax errors might mean you missed a colon or a parenthesis!

4. **Need Help with Imports?** 📦
   - Ensure you're using the correct syntax: `from utils import function_name`.
   - Check if your `utils.py` is in the same directory as your `main.py`.

Keep experimenting and don’t hesitate to ask for help when needed! 🚀
