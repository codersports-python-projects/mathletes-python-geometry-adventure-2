## Hints & Tips for Code Detectives 🔍🕵️‍♂️

Stuck on your debugging adventure? Here are some hints to help you out:

- **Read the Error Message**: If Python gives you an error, read it carefully! It usually tells you which line is causing the problem.
- **Check Your Calculations**: If the numbers aren't adding up, double-check your math. Remember, a square's perimeter is `4 * side_length` and its area is `side_length ** 2`.
- **Use Print Statements**: Print out variables at different points to see what values they hold.
- **Take a Break**: Sometimes stepping away and returning with fresh eyes helps you spot mistakes you missed before.

Keep these tips handy, and you'll solve any coding mystery in no time!
