## Hints ðŸ’¡

- **Installing Libraries**: If you're having trouble installing `colorama`, make sure your internet connection is stable and that you've activated your Python environment.
- **Colorama Usage**: Remember to reset the style after coloring text with `Style.RESET_ALL` to avoid affecting other texts.
- **Input Validation**: Use `try-except` blocks to catch errors when converting input to a number. This ensures your program doesn't crash on invalid input.
- **Efficient Coding**: If your code seems repetitive, think about how you can use loops or functions to make it more efficient.
- **Profiling**: When using `cProfile`, look for functions that take the most time and see if you can optimize them.
