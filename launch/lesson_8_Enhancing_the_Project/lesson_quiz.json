                    "The text 'Error!' will be printed in blue",
                    "The text 'Error!' will be printed without color"
                ],
                "answer": "The text 'Error!' will be printed in red",
                "explanation": "The `Fore.RED` from `colorama` colors the text in red, and `Style.RESET_ALL` resets the color."
