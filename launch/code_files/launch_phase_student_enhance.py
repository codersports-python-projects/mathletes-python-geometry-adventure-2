# Mathletes: Python Geometry Adventure 2 - launch_phase_student_enhancements.py

# This file is part of the "Launch" phase enhancements for the Mathletes project.
# In this phase, you will add optional features, optimize performance, and improve logging.
# Follow the "TODO" markers to know where to add your enhancements.

# Import necessary modules
import logging

# Set up basic logging configuration

    Enhance the Mathletes project by adding new features and optimizations.

    logging.info("Starting project enhancements...")

    # TODO: Add performance optimizations
    # Hint: Consider optimizing data structures or algorithms used in the project.

    # TODO: Implement additional features
    # Hint: Think about what new features could make the project more engaging or educational.

    # TODO: Improve logging
    # Hint: Add more detailed logging to track the flow of the program and capture important events.

# Additional Suggestions:
# - Consider using Python's built-in libraries to enhance functionality (e.g., itertools, functools).
# - Explore third-party libraries for advanced features (e.g., pandas for data manipulation).
# - Always test your enhancements to ensure they work as expected and do not introduce new bugs.
