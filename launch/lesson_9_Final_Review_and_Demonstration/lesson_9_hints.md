### Hints to Help You Shine! 🌟

- **Having Trouble with Code Functionality?**
  - Take a break and revisit your code with fresh eyes. Sometimes stepping away helps you spot errors more easily. 👀

  - It’s okay to pause and think. You can say something like, "That's a great question, let me think about that for a moment." ⏳
  - If you don’t know the answer, be honest. You can say, "I’m not sure, but I’ll find out and get back to you!" 🙋‍♂️
