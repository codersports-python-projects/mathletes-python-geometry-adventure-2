  "detailed_module_responsibilities": {
    "main_py": "The main.py module serves as the central hub of the 'Mathletes: Python Geometry Adventure 2' application. It is responsible for initializing the game environment, setting up the main game loop, and orchestrating the flow of the program. This module integrates various components by coordinating interactions between different modules, managing the game state, and handling user input and output. It displays welcome messages, instructions, and navigates users through different stages of the adventure, from user setup to challenge selection and solution evaluation. The main.py module ensures a seamless user experience by managing transitions between different parts of the application.",
    "utils_py": "The utils.py module is dedicated to providing helper functions and shared utilities that support the core functionality of the application. It includes functions for input validation, data formatting, and common mathematical operations that are used across different modules. This module promotes code reusability and maintainability by centralizing common tasks and operations, reducing redundancy, and ensuring consistency throughout the application. By encapsulating these utility functions, utils.py simplifies the development process and enhances the overall efficiency of the codebase.",
    "features_py": "The features.py module is responsible for implementing additional interactive features that enhance the user experience within the 'Mathletes: Python Geometry Adventure 2' application. It includes functionalities such as the hint system, interactive problem-solving guides, and dynamic visualizations. This module leverages Python libraries to create engaging and educational experiences, such as generating plots with Matplotlib or providing step-by-step guidance for solving challenges. The features.py module enriches the learning journey by offering interactive elements that motivate and assist users in their mathematical and programming endeavors."
  },
  "detailed_interface_contracts": "The modules within the 'Mathletes: Python Geometry Adventure 2' application interact and share data through a well-defined interface contract. The main.py module acts as the central controller, invoking functions from utils.py to perform input validation and data formatting tasks. It also calls upon features.py to access interactive features and visualizations. Data sharing is facilitated through structured data formats, such as dictionaries and lists, which are passed between modules to maintain user profiles, challenge data, and progress tracking. The modules communicate via function calls and shared data structures, ensuring a cohesive and integrated application workflow. The interface contracts are designed to promote modularity, allowing each module to focus on its specific responsibilities while contributing to the overall functionality of the application."
