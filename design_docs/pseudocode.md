# Detailed Pseudocode for Mathletes: Python Geometry Adventure 2

## Pseudocode Outline

1. **Start Adventure** 🚀
   - Initialize the game environment.
     - Set up the main game loop.
     - Initialize global variables for user data and game state.
   - Display welcome message and instructions.
     - Print a colorful welcome banner.
     - Show a brief introduction to the game and its objectives.

2. **User Setup** 🧑‍💻
   - Prompt user for name and age.
     - Use `input()` function to gather user data.
     - Store the input in variables `user_name` and `user_age`.
   - Validate user input.
     - Check if `user_age` is a number and within the age range 10 to 14.
     - If invalid, prompt the user again.
   - Store user profile.
     - Create a dictionary `user_profile` with keys `name`, `age`, and `progress`.
     - Initialize `progress` to an empty list.

3. **Select Challenge** 🔍
   - Present a list of geometry challenges.
     - Define a list `challenges` with elements like "Calculate Area", "Estimate Volume".
     - Display the list with numbered options.
   - Allow user to select a challenge.
     - Prompt the user to enter the number of the challenge they wish to attempt.
     - Validate the selection to ensure it corresponds to a valid option.

4. **Load Challenge Module** 📚
   - Import the relevant Python module for the selected challenge.
     - Use `import` statement to load necessary modules.
     - Initialize challenge-specific variables based on selection.

5. **Solve Challenge** 🧠
   - Present problem statement and data.
     - Display the challenge description and any given data.
   - Guide user through solving the problem using Python code.
     - Provide a code editor interface for user input.
     - Offer step-by-step hints if the user requests help.
   - Provide hints and tips as needed.
     - Implement a hint system that can be accessed by the user.

6. **Visualize Solution** 📊
   - Use Python libraries to visualize the solution.
     - Import `matplotlib` for plotting graphs or figures.
     - Generate visual representation of the solution.
     - Display the plot or geometric figure to the user.

7. **Evaluate Solution** ✅
   - Check user’s solution for correctness.
     - Compare user output with expected results.
     - Use conditional statements to verify accuracy.
   - Provide feedback and scoring.
     - Display feedback message based on correctness.
     - Update `user_profile['progress']` with the challenge status.

8. **Repeat or End Adventure** 🔄
   - Offer option to try another challenge or exit.
     - Ask the user if they want to attempt another challenge.
     - If yes, return to step 3.
     - If no, proceed to save progress.
   - Save progress and exit gracefully.
     - Write `user_profile` data to a file for persistence.
     - Display a farewell message and exit the program.
