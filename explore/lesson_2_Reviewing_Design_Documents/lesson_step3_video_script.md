# 📚 Mathletes: Python Geometry Adventure 2 - Lesson 2: Reviewing Design Documents 🚀

## 🌟 Step 3: Bringing Designs to Life!

### 🎬 Scene 1: The Power of Design Documents 🔑

**Instructor:**

Hey Mathletes! Are you ready to dive into the world where creativity meets logic? Today, we're going to explore how to transform our design documents into real Python magic! 🧙‍♂️✨

Design documents are like the treasure maps of coding! 🗺️ They guide us on our journey to create amazing programs. Let's see how we can use these maps to build something awesome!

### 🎨 Scene 2: Decoding the Design

**Instructor:**

First, let's revisit our design document. Imagine it's a blueprint for a magnificent castle! 🏰

- **Structure Overview**: 
  - **Inputs**: What do we need? 🎯
  - **Outputs**: What do we want to achieve? 🎯
  - **Processes**: How do we get there? 🛤️

### 🔍 Scene 3: Translating Design to Code

**Instructor:**

Now, the fun part! Let's translate this design into Python code. Remember, each part of our design document corresponds to a piece of code.

**Example Code Snippet:**
```python
# Define inputs
sides = 3  # 🟡 Number of sides
length = 5  # 🔵 Length of each side

# Process
perimeter = sides * length  # Calculating the perimeter of a polygon

# Output
print("The perimeter is:", perimeter)  # Displaying the result
```

Watch how our design becomes a lively Python program! 🐍🎉

### 🚀 Scene 4: Final Touches and Review

**Instructor:**

Let's wrap it up, Mathletes! Before we launch our program into the world:

- **Check Your Steps**: Ensure every part of the design is represented in the code. ✅
- **Test Your Code**: Run it and see if it matches your expected outcomes. 🧪

### 🎉 Conclusion: Ready, Set, Code!

**Instructor:**

You've done it! You've turned a design document into a working piece of code. 🌟

- **Remember**: 
  - Design documents are your guides.
  - Each step in coding should reflect your design.
  - Testing ensures your code is rock solid! 🏆

Now go forth, Mathletes, and build your geometric wonders with Python! Until next time, keep coding and stay curious! 👩‍💻👨‍💻
