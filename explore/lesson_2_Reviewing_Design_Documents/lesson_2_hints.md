### Hints for Our Mathletes 🕵️‍♂️📝

- **Stuck on Design Documents?** Remember, these are like your project blueprints. Look for sections like Purpose, Components, and Interaction to uncover the secrets of your project.
- **Need Help with Pseudocode?** Start simple! Write your steps in plain language. Think about what your program needs to do first, next, and last.
- **Confused About Architecture?** Break it down! Identify the main parts of your project and how they connect. Think of it as building with blocks—one piece at a time!

When in doubt, take a deep breath, and review the examples given in the lesson. You've got this, Mathletes! 🚀
