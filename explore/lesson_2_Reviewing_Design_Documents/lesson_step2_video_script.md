## Lesson 2: Reviewing Design Documents 📜💡

### 🎯 Objective:
Hey there, young coders! Today, we're diving into the exciting world of **design documents**. Why, you ask? Because every great project starts with a great plan! 🗺️

### 🏗️ What is a Design Document?
A design document is like a blueprint for your code. Imagine you’re building a treehouse. You wouldn’t start hammering nails without a plan, right? 🛠️

Here’s what our design document will help us with:
- **Understand the requirements** 🌟
- **Plan our code structure** 🏛️
- **Communicate ideas clearly** 💬

### 📑 Key Components of a Design Document:
1. **Requirements**: What does the project need to achieve? 🎯
2. **Specifications**: How are we going to achieve it? 🤔
3. **Diagrams**: Visuals to illustrate the plan 🖼️
4. **Code Snippets**: Examples of how parts of the code might look 🧩

### 🔍 Diving Into Each Component:

#### 1. Requirements 🎯
Let's say we're designing a program to calculate the area of different shapes. Our requirements might include:
- Calculate areas for squares, rectangles, and circles.
- Display results in a user-friendly manner. 🖥️

#### 2. Specifications 🤔
This is where we decide on the details:
- **Input**: User enters the dimensions of the shape.
- **Process**: Use formulas to calculate the area (e.g., Area of a square = side × side, wow! 🤓).
- **Output**: Show the calculated area.

#### 3. Diagrams 🖼️
Visual aids can make everything clearer! Here’s a simple flowchart of our program:
```
[Start] --> [Input Dimensions] --> [Calculate Area] --> [Show Result] --> [End]
```

#### 4. Code Snippets 🧩
Here’s a sneak peek at how part of our code might look in Python:
```python
# Function to calculate the area of a square

def calculate_square_area(side):
    return side * side
```

### 🥳 Wrapping Up
Remember, Mathletes, every great adventure starts with a solid plan! 🌟 Design documents are your treasure map in the coding world. They guide you, keep you on track, and ensure you don’t miss any treasure along the way! 🏴‍☠️
