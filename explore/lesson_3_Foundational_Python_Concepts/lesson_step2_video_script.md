# Lesson 3: Foundational Python Concepts 🚀

## Explore Phase: Step 2 🌟

### Introduction 🎉

Hey Mathletes! Are you ready to dive deeper into the magical world of Python? 🐍 Today, we're going to explore **Foundational Python Concepts** that are the building blocks for your coding adventure. Let's get started! 🎈

### Variables and Data Types 🔑

#### What is a Variable? 🤔

- **Variables** are like little containers 🗃️ in your computer’s memory where you can store information.
- Imagine a variable as a box where you can put a piece of information, like your favorite number or a name.

📦 **Example:**

```python
favorite_number = 7
name = "Alex"
```

Here, `favorite_number` is a variable storing the number 7, and `name` is a variable storing the word "Alex".

#### Different Data Types in Python 📊

1. **Integers** (Whole numbers like 1, 2, 3)
2. **Floats** (Decimal numbers like 3.1415)
3. **Strings** (Text surrounded by quotes like "Hello, World!")

🔍 **Example:**

```python
age = 13      # Integer
height = 5.5  # Float
message = "Welcome to Python!"  # String
```

#### Fun Fact 🥳

Python can do math just like a calculator! 🧮

```python
sum = 5 + 3
product = 4 * 2
```

Try these on your own and see what you get! 💪

### Basic Operations 🔄

Python can perform basic math operations:

- **Addition (+)**
- **Subtraction (-)**
- **Multiplication (*)**
- **Division (/)**

🔧 **Example:**

```python
# Let's do some math!
a = 10
b = 2

add_result = a + b  # Add
sub_result = a - b  # Subtract
mul_result = a * b  # Multiply
div_result = a / b  # Divide
```

Try and change the numbers above and see how the results change! 🎈

### Practice Challenge 🎯

Before we wrap up, here's a quick challenge for you!

1. Create a variable named `my_age` and set it to your age.
2. Create another variable named `my_height` and set it to your height.
3. Print both variables.

🔍 **Example:**

```python
my_age = 12
my_height = 4.9

print("My Age:", my_age)
print("My Height:", my_height)
```

Feel free to change the numbers to your actual age and height! 🌟
