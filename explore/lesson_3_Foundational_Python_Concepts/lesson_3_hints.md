### Hints for Stuck Mathletes! ðŸ¤”ðŸ’¡

**Need a nudge with functions?**
- Remember, a function is defined using `def` followed by the function name and parentheses. Don't forget to use a colon (`:`) at the end of the function definition line!
- When calling a function, make sure to pass the correct number of arguments as defined.

**Looping troubles?**
- Check your loop range: `range(start, stop)` includes the `start` number but stops just before the `stop` number.
- Want to loop through a list? Use `for item in list_name:` to iterate over each element.

**Stuck on data structures?**
- Lists are indexed starting from `0`. So, `fruits[0]` gives you the first fruit!
- Use curly braces `{}` to define a dictionary, with keys and values separated by colons, like `{'key': 'value'}`.
