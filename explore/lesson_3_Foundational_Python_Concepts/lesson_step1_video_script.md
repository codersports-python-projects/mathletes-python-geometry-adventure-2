### 🎬 Welcome to Mathletes: Python Geometry Adventure 2! 🚀

#### Lesson 3: Foundational Python Concepts 🌟

---

👋 **Hey there, Mathletes!** Welcome back to our Python Geometry Adventure! Today, we're diving into some foundational Python concepts that are going to power up your coding skills! 💪 Let's get ready for a fun exploration! 🧭

### Step 1: Introduction to Variables and Data Types 📊🔤

#### What are Variables? 🤔

Variables are like little containers where we can store information. Imagine them as boxes with labels on them. You can put anything in these boxes, like numbers, words, or even other boxes! 🎁

- **Why do we use variables?**
  - To store information that we want to use later.
  - To make our code easy to read and change.

##### Example:
```python
age = 12
name = "Alex"
```
In this example, `age` is a variable storing the number 12, and `name` is a variable storing the word "Alex". ✨

#### Data Types: The Different Kinds of Information 🧩

Just like in life, information comes in different shapes and sizes. In Python, we have several types of data:

- **Integers**: Whole numbers without a decimal point. E.g., `5`, `-3`
- **Floats**: Numbers with a decimal point. E.g., `3.14`, `-0.001`
- **Strings**: Words or sentences. E.g., "Hello, world!"
- **Booleans**: True or False values, like a light switch being on or off. E.g., `True`, `False`

##### Quick Challenge! 🎯
Can you guess the data type of these values?

- `"Mathletes"
- `42`
- `3.14159`
- `False`

#### Using Variables and Data Types in Python 🐍

Let's play with some Python code! 🧑‍💻

```python
# Let's store some information
team_name = "Mathletes"
team_members = 5
win_probability = 0.75
is_winning = True

# Printing out the variables
print("Team Name:", team_name)
print("Number of Members:", team_members)
print("Winning Probability:", win_probability)
print("Is Winning:", is_winning)
```

🔍 **What's Happening Here?**
- We created four variables: `team_name`, `team_members`, `win_probability`, and `is_winning`.
- Each variable holds a different type of data.
- We used the `print()` function to display the information stored in each variable.

#### Your Turn! 🖐

1. Create your own variables to describe your favorite game!
2. Use different data types like we did above.
3. Share your code with a friend and see if they can guess what your favorite game is! 🎮
