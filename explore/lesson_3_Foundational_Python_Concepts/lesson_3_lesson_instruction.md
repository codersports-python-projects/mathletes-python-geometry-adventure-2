# Lesson 3: Foundational Python Concepts 🔍🐍

## Lesson Overview 🌟
Hello, Mathletes! 🚀 Welcome to the world of Python programming! Today, we're going to revisit some essential Python concepts that will be your trusty tools throughout this coding adventure. We'll dive into functions, loops, and data structures — the building blocks of any great Python project. Ready to master these powerful concepts? Let's go! 💪🔑

## What You Will Learn 🧠
- **Functions**: Learn how to create and use functions to organize your code and make it reusable.
- **Loops**: Understand how to use loops to repeat code and automate repetitive tasks.
- **Data Structures**: Explore lists and dictionaries to store and manage data efficiently.

## Lesson Key Concepts 🔑
- **Functions**: Blocks of reusable code that perform a specific task.
- **Loops**: Structures that repeat code until a condition is met.
- **Data Structures**: Ways to store and organize data in your programs, like lists and dictionaries.

## Lesson Learning Objectives 🎯
- Write and use functions in Python.
- Implement loops to iterate over data.
- Utilize lists and dictionaries to manage data effectively.

## Let’s Dive In! 🌊

### Functions: Your Code Superpower 🦸‍♂️🦸‍♀️
Functions are like magic spells for your code! They help you organize your program by grouping code into reusable blocks. Here's how you can create a simple function in Python:

```python
# Function to greet a user

def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}! Welcome to your Python adventure!")

# Calling the function
greet("Alice")
```

### Activity: Create Your Own Function 🎨
Try creating a function that adds two numbers and prints the result. Here's a template to get you started:

```python
# Function to add two numbers
def add_numbers(num1, num2):
    # Your code here

# Call your function with example numbers
add_numbers(5, 3)
```

### Loops: The Power of Repetition 🔄
Loops let you repeat actions in your code — like a dance routine that repeats until the music stops! Let's look at a `for` loop:

```python
# Loop through a list of Mathletes
mathletes = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"]
for mathlete in mathletes:
    print(f"Go, {mathlete}! You're a coding star!")
```

### Interactive Loop Challenge 🚀
Create a loop that prints the numbers from 1 to 10. Can you modify it to print only even numbers?

### Data Structures: Lists and Dictionaries 📚📊
Data structures like lists and dictionaries help you organize information. A list is like a collection of items, and a dictionary pairs keys with values.

#### Example: Lists
```python
# A list of geometric shapes
shapes = ["circle", "square", "triangle"]
print(shapes[0])  # Output: circle
```

#### Example: Dictionaries
```python
# A dictionary of Mathlete scores
scores = {"Alice": 95, "Bob": 88, "Charlie": 92}
print(scores["Alice"])  # Output: 95
```

### Data Structures Activity 🏗️
Create a list of your favorite fruits and a dictionary mapping them to their colors. Share your data structures with a friend!
