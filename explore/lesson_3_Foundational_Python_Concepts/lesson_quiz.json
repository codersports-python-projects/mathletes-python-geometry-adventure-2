            {
                "question": "What is the purpose of a function in Python?",
                "options": [
                    "To repeat a block of code until a condition is met",
                    "To store collections of data",
                    "To organize code into reusable blocks",
                    "To iterate over a sequence"
                ],
                "answer": "To organize code into reusable blocks",
                "explanation": "Functions help organize your code by grouping together related operations, making it reusable and easier to manage."
            },
            {
                "question": "Which of the following is a correct way to define a function in Python?",
                "options": [
                    "def my_function:",
                    "function my_function()",
                    "def my_function():",
                    "my_function() -> def"
                ],
                "answer": "def my_function():",
                "explanation": "In Python, functions are defined using the 'def' keyword followed by the function name and parentheses."
            },
            {
                "question": "How do you access the second element in a list called 'fruits'?",
                "options": [
                    "fruits[2]",
                    "fruits[1]",

                ],
                "answer": "fruits[1]",
                "explanation": "Lists in Python are zero-indexed, so the second element is accessed with index 1."

                ],
                "answer": "0 1 2",
                "explanation": "The range(3) function generates numbers 0 through 2, and the for loop iterates over these numbers."
            },
            {
                "question": "Which statement about dictionaries is true?",
                "options": [
                    "They can store duplicate keys.",
                    "They are ordered collections.",
                    "They use keys to access values.",
                    "They can be indexed with numbers."
                ],
                "answer": "They use keys to access values.",
                "explanation": "Dictionaries use keys to map to values, allowing for fast retrieval of data associated with those keys."
            },
            {
                "question": "How can you iterate over a dictionary called 'scores' to print each key-value pair?",
                "options": [
                    "for key, value in scores:",
                    "for key, value in scores.items():",
                    "for scores in key, value:",
                    "scores.forEach(key, value)"
                ],
                "answer": "for key, value in scores.items():",
                "explanation": "The items() method returns a view object that displays a list of a dictionary's key-value tuple pairs, which can be iterated over in a loop."
