### Instructor:

Hello, Mathletes! 👋 Welcome back to our Python Geometry Adventure! Today, we're diving into Step 2 of our lesson. Are you ready to explore the fascinating world of shapes with Python? Let's go! 🏃‍♂️💨

### 🗺️ Exploring Shapes with Python

In this step, we'll learn how to describe and create basic geometric shapes using Python. We'll uncover the secrets of circles, squares, and triangles. Each shape has its own unique qualities and formulas that we'll explore together! 🎨

#### 🔍 Understanding the Basics:

1. **Circle (🔵):**
   - **Formula for Area:** \( A = \pi r^2 \)
   - **Formula for Circumference:** \( C = 2\pi r \)
   - **Python Example:**
     ```python
     import math
     radius = 5
     area = math.pi * radius ** 2
     circumference = 2 * math.pi * radius
     print("Area:", area)
     print("Circumference:", circumference)
     ```
   - 🚀 **Fun Fact:** Did you know the circle is the shape of the sun? ☀️

2. **Square (⬛):**
   - **Formula for Area:** \( A = side^2 \)
   - **Formula for Perimeter:** \( P = 4 \times side \)
   - **Python Example:**
     ```python
     side = 4
     area = side ** 2
     perimeter = 4 * side
     print("Area:", area)
     print("Perimeter:", perimeter)
     ```
   - 🌟 **Fun Fact:** A square is just a special rectangle! 📐

3. **Triangle (🔺):**
   - **Formula for Area:** \( A = \frac{1}{2} \times base \times height \)
   - **Formula for Perimeter:** \( P = a + b + c \)
   - **Python Example:**
     ```python
     base = 6
     height = 3
     side_a = 5
     side_b = 5
     side_c = 6
     area = 0.5 * base * height
     perimeter = side_a + side_b + side_c
     print("Area:", area)
     print("Perimeter:", perimeter)
     ```
   - 🔑 **Key Insight:** Triangles are nature's strongest shape! 🏗️

### 🎨 Visualizing Shapes

Let's take a moment to visualize these shapes. Imagine a big, bright circle, a neatly arranged square, and a pointy triangle. Visual aids help us understand these concepts better. 🖼️

- **Circle:** Imagine drawing a pizza 🍕
- **Square:** Think of a chessboard square ♟️
- **Triangle:** Picture a slice of watermelon 🍉

### 🤔 Quick Quiz Time!

Let's test our knowledge:

- Can you calculate the area of a circle with a radius of 7?
- What is the perimeter of a square with a side length of 3?
- How would you find the area of a triangle with a base of 8 and height of 4?

Write down your answers, and let's check them together in our next session! 📝

### 🏆 Wrap-Up

Great job, Mathletes! You've made it through Step 2 of our Python Geometry Adventure. Keep practicing these concepts, and soon you'll be a geometry whiz! Until next time, keep exploring and coding! 🔍💻
