### Hints for Geometry Adventure 🚀

1. **Stuck on calculating the area or perimeter? 🤔**
   - Remember, the **area** is the space inside the shape, while the **perimeter** is the distance around it. For circles, the area formula involves `pi` (π). For squares, multiply one side by itself for the area and all sides for the perimeter.

2. **Confused about the code? 💻**
   - Double-check your indentation! Python relies on correct indentation to understand code blocks.
   - Make sure you’re importing the `math` module if you need to use `math.pi` or `math.sqrt`.

3. **Need help with a specific shape? 🔍**
   - For circles, remember `radius` is key. For triangles, each side matters. For squares and rectangles, focus on side lengths.

4. **Visualizing the flowchart? 🌈**
   - Visualize each step in the flowchart as a path you follow in your code. It helps to write down each step to understand the process better.
