## Let's Get Started! 💡
Imagine you're an explorer, just like Indiana Jones, but instead of searching for ancient artifacts, you're going on a quest to uncover the secrets of math using Python! 🏺💻

### Meet the Python
Python is a powerful programming language that's as friendly as a pet! 🐍 It's the perfect tool for kids and teens to learn programming concepts while having fun with math.

### Your First Challenge - Circles and Squares!
Let's start with something simple: **Circles** and **Squares**! What if you could calculate the area and perimeter of these shapes using Python?

#### Here's Your Code Snippet to Get Started:
```python
# Calculate the area and perimeter of a circle
import math

def circle_area(radius):
    return math.pi * (radius ** 2)

def circle_perimeter(radius):
    return 2 * math.pi * radius

# Calculate the area and perimeter of a square
def square_area(side):
    return side * side

def square_perimeter(side):
    return 4 * side

# Test your functions
print("Area of circle: ", circle_area(5))
print("Perimeter of circle: ", circle_perimeter(5))
print("Area of square: ", square_area(4))
print("Perimeter of square: ", square_perimeter(4))
```

### Visualizing with Mermaid
Here's a simple flowchart to understand the process of calculating areas:

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Start] --> B{Choose Shape};
    B --> C[Circle];
    B --> D[Square];
    C --> E[Input Radius];
    D --> F[Input Side Length];
    E --> G[Calculate Area & Perimeter];
    F --> G;
    G --> H[Output Results];
    H --> I[End];
```

## Wrap Up 🎩
Congratulations, Mathlete! You've taken your first step into the world of Python Geometry. Remember, every great coder started with a single line of code. Keep practicing, and soon you'll be solving math puzzles like a pro. Stay curious, and see you in the next lesson! 👋
