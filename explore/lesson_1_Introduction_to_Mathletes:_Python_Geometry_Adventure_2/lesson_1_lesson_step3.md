# Step 3: The Geometry Adventure Continues! 🚀🌈

Hello again, intrepid Mathletes! Are you ready to level up your geometry skills and become a master of shapes? Today, we'll wrap up our exploration of basic shapes and set the stage for even more exciting adventures. Let's dive right in! 🌊🐠

## Unlocking the Secrets of More Shapes 🔑

So far, we've explored circles, squares, triangles, and rectangles. But the world of geometry is vast, and there are more shapes waiting for us to discover their secrets!

### The Mysterious Pentagon 🔺🔻

The pentagon is a five-sided shape that often reminds us of stars. You might see it in nature, architecture, and art. Let's uncover its mysteries:

- **Perimeter**: The total length around the pentagon.
- **Area**: The space inside its five sides.

Here's how you can calculate the perimeter of a regular pentagon (where all sides are equal):

```python
# Calculate the perimeter of a regular pentagon
def pentagon_perimeter(side):
    return 5 * side

# Test the function
print("Perimeter of pentagon: ", pentagon_perimeter(6))
```

### The Hexagon’s Harmony 🔷🔶

Hexagons are found in honeycombs and are known for their efficiency and beauty. With six equal sides, they form a perfect harmony.

- **Perimeter**: The sum of all six sides.

Here's how you can calculate it:

```python
# Calculate the perimeter of a regular hexagon
def hexagon_perimeter(side):
    return 6 * side

# Test the function
print("Perimeter of hexagon: ", hexagon_perimeter(4))
```

## Interactive Challenge: Shape Detective 🕵️‍♀️🕵️‍♂️

Now it’s your turn to be a shape detective! Use the code snippets to explore these new shapes. Try different side lengths to see how the perimeter changes. Can you predict the results before running the code? 🤔

### Flowchart: The Shape Explorer
Here’s a flowchart to guide your exploration and calculations:

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Start] --> B{Choose Shape};
    B --> C[Pentagon];
    B --> D[Hexagon];
    C --> E[Input Side Length];
    D --> F[Input Side Length];
    E --> G[Calculate Perimeter];
    F --> G;
    G --> H[Output Results];
    H --> I[End];
```

## Action Item: The Shape Challenge 🎮
1. **Experiment with Code**: Open your Python editor and try out the code snippets for pentagons and hexagons.
2. **Predict and Explore**: Change the side lengths and predict the perimeter.
3. **Reflect**: What do you notice about these shapes? How do they compare to the ones you've studied before?
